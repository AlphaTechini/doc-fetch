## 💻 Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `fix/content-extraction-bug`
- `feat/add-pdf-support`
- `docs/update-readme-examples`
- `perf/improve-concurrent-fetching`

### Code Style

Follow Go best practices:
- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Run `go vet` to catch issues
- Write clear, concise comments
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing Requirements

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Include edge cases
- Test with real documentation sites

Example test:
```go
func TestContentExtraction(t *testing.T) {
    doc := createTestDocument()
    content := cleanContent(doc)
    
    if len(content) == 0 {
        t.Error("Expected content to be extracted")
    }
    
    if !strings.Contains(content, "expected text") {
        t.Error("Expected content to contain specific text")
    }
}
