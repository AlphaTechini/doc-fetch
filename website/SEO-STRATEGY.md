# DocFetch SEO Strategy

## Modern SEO Reality Check (2026)

You're right - **meta tags alone don't rank anymore**. Google's algorithm updates (Helpful Content Update, Core Updates) prioritize:

1. **Content depth** - Comprehensive answers, not keyword stuffing
2. **Topic authority** - Multiple articles showing expertise
3. **User engagement** - Time on page, low bounce rate, return visitors
4. **Fresh content** - Regular updates signal active site
5. **Backlinks** - Other sites linking to your content
6. **E-E-A-T** - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness

## Our Content Strategy

❌ Comment spam with links

❌ Automated link building tools  

## Measuring Success

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Average time on page (target: >3 min for long posts)
- Bounce rate (target: <60% for blog)
- Pages per session
- Return visitor rate

**SEO Metrics:**

## Competitive Analysis

### Who We're Competing With

**Direct Competitors:**
- Mercury Parser (mercury.postlight.com)
- Web Scraper IO (webscraper.io)
- ParseHub (parsehub.com)

**Indirect Competitors:**
- Generic web scrapers (Beautiful Soup tutorials)
- Custom scripts (GitHub repos)
- Manual copy-paste (the real enemy 😄)

### Our Differentiators

1. **AI-focused** - Built specifically for LLM context, not general scraping
2. **LLM.txt standard** - Semantic indexing, not just content extraction
3. **Developer-first** - CLI tool, not SaaS with login walls
4. **Open source** - Transparent, auditable, extensible
5. **Cross-platform** - Python, Node.js, Go, binaries

### Content Gaps We Can Exploit

Competitors focus on:
- General web scraping
- Enterprise features
- Visual point-and-click interfaces

We'll focus on:
- AI/LLM use cases
- Developer workflow integration
- Open source transparency
- Educational content (guides, tutorials)

## Algorithm Update Preparedness

Google updates its algorithm constantly. Here's how to stay safe:

### Evergreen Principles

✅ **Quality content** - Comprehensive, accurate, helpful  
✅ **User-first approach** - Write for humans, not bots  
✅ **Regular updates** - Keep content fresh and accurate  
✅ **Natural links** - Earned through quality, not manipulated  
✅ **Technical excellence** - Fast, mobile-friendly, accessible  

### Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Thin content** - Short, shallow posts without substance  
❌ **Keyword stuffing** - Unnatural repetition  
❌ **Clickbait titles** - Promise what content doesn't deliver  
❌ **Duplicate content** - Copying others or yourself  
❌ **Paid links** - Buying backlinks  

### If an Update Hits Us

1. Don't panic-rankings often recover in weeks
2. Analyze what dropped (which pages, which keywords)
3. Compare to competitors (did everyone drop?)
4. Improve content quality where needed
5. Wait it out (most updates stabilize in 2-4 weeks)
